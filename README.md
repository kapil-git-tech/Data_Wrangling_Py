# Data_Wrangling_Py
Data Wrangling in python

The following notebook provides an overview on data wrangling in Python using a live "Insurance" case study. The goal this case study 
tries to achieve is to find the best performing agencies. An illustration is provided to derive the best performing agencies using EDA.
(Future study: Although advanced data science techniques can also be used to identify best performing agencies, they have been excluded from this case study/notebook.)

The notebook was originally created in Kaggle using an insurance dataset.

The kaggle notebook can be found at this location: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kapilstp84/data-wrangling-case-study 

The notebook will come handy for people who have started their data science journey. It provides sample code for below:

1. Outlier & missing value treatment in pandas dataframe
2. Slicing (loc, isin)
3. Subplots from matplotlib
4. Aggregation (Group By, SORTING - ascending & descending, SLICING using Head(x) 
5. Plotting BAR Charts

Wherever necessary, the definitions of insurance terms are provided.
